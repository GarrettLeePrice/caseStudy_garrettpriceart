          <h3>garrettpriceart.com is my fine art portfolio site. Until now, I
          have relied on friends with web knowledge to create and maintain my
          site. I've had a hard time getting the design dialed in to the
          aesthetics that please my own eye. I have also not had the ability to
          update the site with new art and upcomming show info as frequently as
          I would like. A few key features were also missing; a store page to
          purchase artwork directly, and a full gallery of work with
          appropriate title info for each work on the gallery. The primary
          goals of the re-design are; to present my art in a more visually
          appealing and interesting way, bring in more visitors with better and
          more frequently updated content, and increase online art sales.</h3>

        <p>User personas were created to help define the needs of the site users.
        A couple of pieces of feedback that I found particularly useful were the
        types of devices the different users would view the website from. A fully
        responsive website is one key to this website being successful. Versions
        for mobile and tablet user are currently in production.</p><img alt=""

        <p>My initial rough design for the site was a continuous scrolling flow.
        All of the gallery links, shop and blog on one page. This design style
        was too cluttered, so I moved on to a cleaner approach.</p><img class=
        "img-responsive" src="img/roughDrafts.png"></div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>I created a user flow diagram to map the flow from page to page via
        clicking the navigation links.</p><img class="img-responsive" src=

          <p>A typography style guide was created. RACING SANS ONE was the choice
          for headline text for is bold, clean and modern feel. OPEN SANS was
          chosen for its sleek, easy-to-read, modern feel which lends itself well
          for small text/body copy.</p><img alt="" src="img/typeImg.png"></div>

        <div class="color">
        <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The color choices were made to lighten the overall tone of the site,
        while focusing the interest on the gallery images of art. A single
        color, bright yellow, was used to give contrast to the muted gray
        tones. The yellow also gives a sense of energy to the color
        palette.</p><img alt="" src="img/colorImg.png"></div>

      <div class="navDesign">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>I created a custom illustration and logo to draw attention to the
        navigation links at the bottom of each page. The grey bar design
        element draws the eye to the navigation links. The navigation links
        stay in a static position across all pages, leading to simplified
        controls.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/navDesign.png"></div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Pop-out windows were created to give the full size view of the art
        thumbnails in the galleries. Each full-size view includes
        title/dimmension/medium info for the piece being viewed. Buy now links
        are added to the full-size view, and each shop item thumbnail as
        well.</p>
