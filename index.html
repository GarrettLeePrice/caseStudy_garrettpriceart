        <h3>garrettpriceart.com is my fine art portfolio site. Until now, I
        have relied on friends with web knowledge to create and maintain my
        site. I've had a hard time getting the design dialed in to the
        aesthetics that please my own eye. I haven't had the ability to update
        the site with new art and upcoming show info as frequently as I would
        like. A few key features were also missing; a store page to purchase
        artwork directly, and a full gallery of artwork with title info for
        each work on the gallery.</h3><br>
        <h3>The primary goals of the re-design are; to present my art in a more
        visually appealing and interesting way, bring in more visitors with
        better and more frequently updated content, and increase online art
        sales.</h3>

      <p>User personas were created to help define the needs of the site users.
      A couple of pieces of feedback that I found particularly useful were the
      types of devices the different users would view the website from. A fully
      responsive website is one key to this website being successful. Versions
      for mobile and tablet user are currently in production.</p><img alt=""

      <p>My initial rough designs for the site was a continuous scrolling flow.
      All of the gallery links,</p>
      <p>shop and blog on one page. This design style was too cluttered, so I
      moved on to a cleaner approach.</p><img class="img-responsive" src=

      <p>The final draft of the site has a large image on the landing page,
      with navigation links at the bottom of the page.</p><img class=
      "img-responsive" src="img/HOMEPAGEv2.png"></div>
      <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>I created a user flow diagram to map the flow from page to page via
      clicking the navigation links.</p><img class="img-responsive" src=

        <p>A typography style guide was created. RACING SANS ONE was the choice
        for headline text for is bold, clean and modern feel. OPEN SANS was
        chosen for its sleek, easy-to-read, modern feel which lends itself well
        for small text/body copy.</p><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src=

        <div class="col-xs-6">
        <p>The color choices were made to lighten the overall tone of the site,
        while focusing the interest on the gallery images of art. A single
        color, bright yellow, was used to give contrast to the muted gray
        tones. The yellow also gives a sense of energy to the color
        palette.</p><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src=

      <div class="navDesign">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>I created a custom illustration and logo to draw attention to the
        navigation links at the bottom of each page. The grey bar</p>
        <p>design element draws the eye to the navigation links. The navigation
        links stay in a static position across all pages, leading</p>
        <p>to simplified controls.</p><img class="img-responsive" src=

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Pop-out windows were created to give the full size view of the art
        thumbnails in the galleries. Each full-size view includes
        title/dimmension/medium info for the piece being viewed. Buy now links
        are added to the full-size view, and each shop item thumbnail as
        well.</p>
